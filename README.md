# Health Practice Web App

## Introduction
This project was one of my coursework assignments at university. The aim of this project is to design and build a web application for capturing and maintaining electronic health records for a network of health practices. The application is built using React and relevant JavaScript-based frameworks and is intended to help patients, doctors, and practitioners access relevant information and services offered by the practices. This is just the front-end code for this project. The back-end code is in another code base.

## Features
- **Patient Registration:** New patients can self-register by providing their name, date of birth, address, email, and password.
- **Appointment Booking:** Patients can book appointments after approval by an admin, describing their health issues.
- **Appointment Management:** Practitioners can review, accept, reject, or offer alternatives to appointment requests.
- **Medical History Management:** Doctors can update medical history, generate electronic prescriptions, and order tests.
- **Patient Records:** Patients can view their electronic records, including upcoming appointments and test results.
- **Notifications:** Patients are notified when test results are available.
- **Data Privacy:** The application adheres to GDPR guidelines for data protection.
- **Open Data Integration:** Integration with open data sources for visualizing available pharmacies using a map.
